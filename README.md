# data-structure
Provide some implementations of standard data structures written in javascript.
I'm actually use it to prepare for an interview and I think is a good point to start also for students or interested people.

Actually I have been implemented the heap and priority-queue data structures, for each of one I also wrote some usage methods and the main sorting methods.
