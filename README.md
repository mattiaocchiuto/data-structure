# data-structures and algorithms
Provide some implementations of standard data structures and algorithms written in javascript.
I'm actually use it to prepare for an interview and I think is a good point to start also for students or interested people.

Data structures implemented:
- heap (max)
- priority queue (max)
- stack
- queue
- linked-list

Algorithms:
- Comparision type:
	- insert sort
	- bubble sort
	- quick sort

- Linear time type:
	- counting sort
