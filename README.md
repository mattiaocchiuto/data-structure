# data-structure and algorithms
Provide some implementations of standard data structures and algorithms written in javascript.
I'm actually use it to prepare for an interview and I think is a good point to start also for students or interested people.

Data structures implemented:
- heap (max)
- priority queue (max)

Algorithms:
- insert sort
- bubble sort
- quick sort
